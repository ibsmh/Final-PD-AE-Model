# Final-PD-AE-Model
Parkinson’s disease is classified as a chronic and progressive neurological ailment that impacts an individual’s motor functions and balance. Additionally, it is known to have a discernible impact on the vocal abilities of those afflicted. Parkinson’s disease is initiated by a decrease in the number of dopamine neurons present in the brain.
 
 This project is a part of my final thesis in Master Degree.

 First: I had to do EDA for all voice recordings, then I trasfer it from audio form into numeric form with Parselmouth Library in python.
 Second: Do the tradtional ML algorithms.
 Third: Do MLP algorithm.
 Finally: Apply Deep Auto-Encoder as a features extraction, & MLP algorithm as a classifier.
